# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

Launchpad's latest major version always received security updates. Previous versions typically do not, so you should 
always use the latest supported version.

| Version | Supported          |
| ------- | ------------------ |
| 6.x     | :white_check_mark: |
| < 6.0   | :x:                |

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you find a security vulnerability, please do NOT open an issue or disclose the vulnerability publicly. Any security issues should be sent directly to security@volantisdev.com with as much detail as you can so that we can assess the impact and come up with a solution before divulging the issue to potential attackers.

Not sure if you're dealing with a bug or a security issue? If you answer yes to any of these questions, it's a security issue:
* Can I access something that I shouldn't have access to?
* Can I do something that puts other Launchpad users at risk?

Even if you're still not sure, email security@volantisdev.com just to be safe. If it turns out it's not a security issue, no harm done!

We ask that you please keep the issue a secret until we fix it and publicly announce it.
